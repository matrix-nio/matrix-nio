"""Matrix Knock Events.

Events for knocked rooms will have a stripped down version of their
counterparts for joined rooms.

Such events will be missing the event id and origin server timestamp.
Since all of the events in an knocked room will be state events they will
never be encrypted.

These events help set up the state of a knocked room so more information can
be displayed to users if they knocked a room.
