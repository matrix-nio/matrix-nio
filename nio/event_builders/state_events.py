"""Matrix state events module.

This module contains classes that can be used to easily create
room state event dicts.

For example, to turn on encryption in a room with the ``HttpClient`` or
``AsyncClient``, the ``EnableEncryptionBuilder`` class can be used:

    >>> event_dict = EnableEncryptionBuilder().as_dict()
    >>> client.room_send(
    ...     room_id      = "!test:example.com",
    ...     message_type = event_dict["type"],
    ...     content      = event_dict["content"],
    ... )
"""
