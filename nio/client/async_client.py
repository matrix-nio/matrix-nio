            an ErrorResponse.
            Default is None for unlimited.

        max_timeouts (int, optional): How many timeout connection errors can
            a request encounter before giving up and raising the error:
            a ClientConnectionError, TimeoutError, or asyncio.TimeoutError.
            Default is None for unlimited.

        backoff_factor (float): A backoff factor to apply between retries
            for timeouts, starting from the second try.
            nio will sleep for `backoff_factor * (2 ** (total_retries - 1))`

            before it is retried or raise an `asycio.TimeoutError` depending

            Defaults to 60 seconds, and can be disabled with `0`.
            `AsyncClient.sync()` overrides this option with its
            `timeout` argument.

class AsyncClient(Client):
    """An async IO matrix client.

    Args:
        homeserver (str): The URL of the homeserver which we want to connect
            to.
        user (str, optional): The user which will be used when we log in to the
            homeserver.
        device_id (str, optional): An unique identifier that distinguishes
            this client instance. If not set the server will provide one after
            log in.
        store_path (str, optional): The directory that should be used for state
            storage.
        config (AsyncClientConfig, optional): Configuration for the client.
        ssl (bool/ssl.SSLContext, optional): SSL validation mode. None for
            default SSL check (ssl.create_default_context() is used), False
            for skip SSL certificate validation connection.
        proxy (str, optional): The proxy that should be used for the HTTP
            connection. Supports SOCKS4(a), SOCKS5, HTTP (tunneling) via an
            URL like e.g. 'socks5://user:password@127.0.0.1:1080'.

    Attributes:
        synced (Event): An asyncio event that is fired every time the client
            successfully syncs with the server. Note, this event will only be
            fired if the `sync_forever()` method is used.

    A simple example can be found bellow.

    Example:
            >>> client = AsyncClient("https://example.org", "example")
            >>> login_response = loop.run_until_complete(
            >>>     client.login("hunter1")
            >>> )
            >>> asyncio.run(client.sync_forever(30000))

    This example assumes a full sync on every run. If a sync token is provided
    for the `since` parameter of the `sync_forever` method `full_state` should
    be set to `True` as well.

    Example:
            >>> asyncio.run(
            >>>     client.sync_forever(30000, since="token123",
            >>>                         full_state=True)
            >>> )

    The client can also be configured to store and restore the sync token
    automatically. The `full_state` argument should be set to `True` in that
    case as well.

    Example:
            >>> config = ClientConfig(store_sync_tokens=True)
            >>> client = AsyncClient("https://example.org", "example",
            >>>                      store_path="/home/example",
            >>>                      config=config)
            >>> login_response = loop.run_until_complete(
            >>>     client.login("hunter1")

        The loop also makes sure to handle other required requests between
        syncs, including to_device messages and sending encryption keys if
        required. To react to the responses a response callback should be
        added.

                anyways, in milliseconds.
                If ``0``, no timeout is applied.
                If ``None``, ``AsyncClient.config.request_timeout`` is used.
                In any case, ``0`` is always used for the first sync.

                state for all rooms the user is a member of. If this is set to
                true, then all state events will be returned, even if since is

                request.

            since (str, optional): A token specifying a point in time where to
                continue the sync from. Defaults to the last sync token we
                received from the server using this API call. This argument
                will be used only for the first sync request, the subsequent
                sync requests will use the token from the last sync response.

                the server's room directory or not.
                Defaults to ``RoomVisibility.private``.

            alias (str, optional): The desired canonical alias local part.
                For example, if set to "foo" and the room is created on the
                "example.com" server, the room alias will be
                "#foo:example.com".

            room_version (str, optional): The room version to set.
                If not specified, the homeserver will use its default setting.
                If a version not supported by the homeserver is specified,
                a 400 ``M_UNSUPPORTED_ROOM_VERSION`` error will be returned.

            federate (bool): Whether to allow users from other homeservers from
                joining the room. Defaults to ``True``.
                Cannot be changed later.

            is_direct (bool): If this should be considered a
                direct messaging room.
                If ``True``, the server will set the ``is_direct`` flag on
                ``m.room.member events`` sent to the users in ``invite``.
                Defaults to ``False``.

            preset (RoomPreset, optional): The selected preset will set various
                rules for the room.
                If unspecified, the server will choose a preset from the
                ``visibility``: ``RoomVisibility.public`` equates to
                ``RoomPreset.public_chat``, and
                ``RoomVisibility.private`` equates to a
                ``RoomPreset.private_chat``.

            invite (list): A list of user id to invite to the room.

            initial_state (list): A list of state event dicts to send when
                the room is created.
                For example, a room could be made encrypted immediately by
                having a ``m.room.encryption`` event dict.

            power_level_override (dict): A ``m.room.power_levels content`` dict
                to override the default.
                The dict will be applied on top of the generated
                ``m.room.power_levels`` event before it is sent to the room.

            predecessor (dict): A reference to the room this room replaces, if the previous room was upgraded.
                Containing the event ID of the last known event in the old room.
                And the ID of the old room.

        This method ignores `AsyncClient.config.request_timeout` and uses `0`.

        Calls receive_response() to update the client state if necessary.

        Returns a tuple containing:

        - Either a `UploadResponse` if the request was successful, or a
          `UploadError` if there was an error with the request

        - A dict with file decryption info if encrypt is ``True``,
          else ``None``.

        Raises a ``TransferCancelledError`` if a monitor is passed and its
        ``cancelled`` property becomes set to ``True``.

        Args:
            data_provider (Callable, SynchronousFile, AsyncFile): A function
                returning the data to upload or a file object. File objects
                must be opened in binary mode (``mode="r+b"``). Callables
                returning a path string, Path, async iterable or aiofiles
                open binary file object allow the file data to be read in an
                asynchronous and lazy way (without reading the entire file
                into memory). Returning a synchronous iterable or standard
                open binary file object will still allow the data to be read
                lazily, but not asynchronously.

                The function will be called again if the upload fails
                due to a server timeout, in which case it must restart
                from the beginning.
                Callables receive two arguments: the total number of
                429 "Too many request" errors that occurred, and the total
                number of server timeout exceptions that occurred, thus
                cleanup operations can be performed for retries if necessary.

            content_type (str): The content MIME type of the file,
                e.g. "image/png".
                Defaults to "application/octet-stream", corresponding to a
                generic binary file.
                Custom values are ignored if encrypt is ``True``.

            filename (str, optional): The file's original name.

            encrypt (bool): If the file's content should be encrypted,
                necessary for files that will be sent to encrypted rooms.
                Defaults to ``False``.

            monitor (TransferMonitor, optional): If a ``TransferMonitor``
                object is passed, it will be updated by this function while
                uploading.
                From this object, statistics such as currently
                transferred bytes or estimated remaining time can be gathered
                while the upload is running as a task; it also allows
                for pausing and cancelling.

            filesize (int, optional): Size in bytes for the file to transfer.
                If left as ``None``, some servers might refuse the upload.

        It's common to use this alongside :py:meth:`room_send`. An example of
        uploading a plain text file follows, but the principle is the same for
        media, you just need to add an additional "info" key to the content.
        See `the Matrix client-server spec <https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.6.0#m-room-message-msgtypes>`_
        for more details.
